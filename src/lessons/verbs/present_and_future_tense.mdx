In Amharic, the simple present and future tense are conjugated the same. For instance:
I go to the store is translated as ወደ ሱቅ እሄዳለሁ.
I will go to the store is also ወደ ሱቅ እሄዳለሁ.

To be clear, this simple present tense is a description of something that happens generally or regularly. This is when I want to say something like “I go to the store every Sunday” or “When I shop, I go to that store.” For a more directly present tense, termed the present continuous tense, the conjugation is different. For example, “I am going to the store now.” We will cover this tense in a later chapter.

import { MeVerbsPatternTable, MeVerbsExampleTable, MaVerbsPatternTable, MaVerbsExampleTable } from '../../components/PresentFutureTenseTables.jsx'

Verbs are prefixed with either መ- or ማ-. These are our two primary verb groups, each with their own conjugation patterns. Here are the conjugation patterns for each type followed by an example:
መ- verbs

<MeVerbsPatternTable />

Example:
መሄድ = to go

<MeVerbsExampleTable />

ማ- verbs

<MaVerbsPatternTable />

Example:
ማሰብ = to think

<MaVerbsExampleTable />


Some patterns to observe:
Suffixes across መ- and ማ- verbs are consistent. The difference between these verb types is in the prefixes.
Starting verbs with “t” (ት for መ- verbs and ታ for ማ- verbs) typically denotes a second person conjugation i.e. “you” did this.
The exception to this is “she,” which also starts with “t”
Starting verbs with “y” (ይ for መ- verbs and ያ for ማ- verbs) typically denotes a third person conjugation i.e. “he” or “they” did this.
Again, the exception to this is “she,” which starts with “t” instead of “y”
The second person female conjugation includes a change to the root. Typically, the “you female” conjugation involves inserting this “eeya” sound in the middle of the word.
For መሄድ, all of the other conjugations have “ሄዳል” in the middle, while the “you female” conjugation has “ሄጂያል”
For ማሰብ, all of the other conjugations have “ስባል” in the middle, while the “you female” conjugation has “ቢያል”
We add the “a” sound between the end of the root and the suffix. It connects the verb root and suffix. For መሄድ, the root ሄድ turns into ሄዳ. For ማሰብ, the root ሰብ turns into ስባ.
We often convert any “e” sounds in the root to an “i” sound. For ማሰብ, the root ሰብ turns into ስባ. 
As we introduce more verbs, it will be easier to pick up these patterns and apply them but it’s just something to keep an eye out for.

I’ve provided the linguistic analysis above for those that are curious, but I wouldn’t take it too seriously. The primary purpose of these lessons is to provide an overview of the language’s grammatical base rather than a comprehensive view of its intricacies. Most native speakers and even skilled learners don’t consciously know most of these patterns because they come naturally with time spent speaking and listening. Eventually, we pick up a sense of what just sounds right.

Early in my learning journey, I found these patterns comforting. With all the irregularities in verb conjugations, it sometimes felt like the process of converting an infinitive into its usable forms was a mystery. Understanding that there are patterns under the surface gave me confidence that I can take a new verb and bring it to life in various scenarios without having to memorize every form.

However, this ability to apply a new verb comes to most learners as an intuition built through practice rather than a set of patterns. So if you find monotony instead of comfort in these patterns, then don’t pay them too much mind. As shown by the majority of speakers, they’re not necessary to become proficient.
