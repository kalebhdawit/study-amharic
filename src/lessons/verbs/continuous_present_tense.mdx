The continuous present tense is used to construct sentences that describe what is happening at that exact moment. For example, “I am eating,” “I am running,” etc.

To use the continuous present tense, we build upon the past tense by adding a present continuous prefix and adding the world ነው (is) after.

The present continuous prefix is…
እየ- (iye-) for መ- verbs
እያ- (iya-) for ማ verbs

We then add “is” to this conjugation. It’s similar to how we use “am” in the English version e.g. I am doing this.

All together, we do:
Prefix (iye- or iya-) + past tense ነው
