Verbs are the engines of language. Our basic building blocks of sentences are nouns and verbs. Of course, language is nothing without adjectives, conjunctions, and so on, but nouns and verbs are non-negotiable. Nouns are easier. A house is always a house, a person is always a person, a place is always a place. Once you know the word, there is not much customization you have to do. This leaves a lot of storytelling for our verbs to do. Actions can be done at any time, by anyone, to anyone, relative to any other action, etc. And all these things matter. Their flexibility means that there is a lot to learn.

Because Amharic is a pro-drop language, each subject/object combination has its own conjugation. English, on the other hand, requires the use of pronouns in sentences, simplifying verb conjugations. For instance, to conjugate the verb “to do” is relatively straightforward: I do, you do, she does, he does, they do. The “do” turns into “does” for she and he, but beyond that, the pronouns convey the context of the action.

Note: In general, the respectful second person and the respectful third person (used when talking to or about a priest, an elder, etc.) are conjugated in the same way as the plural third person (they) is conjugated, so I will leave their conjugations out for brevity.
