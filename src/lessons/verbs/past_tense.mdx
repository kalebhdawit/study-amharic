The past tense introduces three more verb types, but these are differentiated by their suffixes:
Regular verbs (any verbs that don’t end with -et or -at)
-et verbs
-at verbs

To conjugate our base verbs into the present tense, we add a past tense suffix depending on the verb type.

import { RegularVerbsPatternTable, RegularVerbsExampleTable, EtVerbsPatternTable, EtVerbsExampleTable, AtVerbsPatternTable, AtVerbsExampleTable } from '../../components/PastTenseTables.jsx'

Regular verbs

<RegularVerbsPatternTable />

Example:
መሄድ = to go

<RegularVerbsExampleTable />




-et verbs

<EtVerbsPatternTable />

Example:
ማየት = to see

<EtVerbsExampleTable />

-at verbs

<AtVerbsPatternTable />

Example:
መብላት = to see

<AtVerbsExampleTable />


Patterns:
To conjugate into the past tense, we drop the base prefix (መ or ማ)
For መ verbs, we completely drop the prefix
For ማ verbs, we drop the “m” sound but keep the “a” sound at the beginning (see ማየት above)
-et and -at verbs have the same conjugation pattern but the suffix starts with the “e” sound for -et verbs and the “a” sound for -at verbs. For example, for the first person conjugation, our full suffix is -ehu for -et verbs and -ahu for -at verbs.
