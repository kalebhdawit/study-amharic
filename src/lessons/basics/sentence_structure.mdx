Amharic is a Subject-Object-Verb language. The actor of the sentence comes first, then the receiver of the action, and lastly the action. In comparison, English is a Subject-Verb-Object language. Here's an example:

I like soccer.
- Subject: I
- Verb: like
- Object: soccer

In Amharic, this would be:
እኔ እግር ኳስ እወዳለሁ. (Ine igir kwas.)
- Subject: እኔ (ine)
- Object: እግር ኳስ (soccer – literally, it is "foot ball")
- Verb: እወዳለሁ (iwedalehu)

Word for word, this says I soccer like.
