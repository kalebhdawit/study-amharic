To make a noun plural, we add the -ኦች (-och) suffix to the end of the word.

ልጅ (child) turns into ልጆች (children)
ነገር (thing) turns into ነገሮች (things)

If the noun ends with a vowel, the we begin the suffix with a “w” sound: -ዎች (-woch).

ተማሪ (student) turns into ተማሪዎች (students)
ህንጻ (building) turns into ህንጻዎች (buildings)
