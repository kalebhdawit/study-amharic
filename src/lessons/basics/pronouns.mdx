Here are the Amharic pronouns:

In practice, Amharic is a pro-drop language, meaning that many sentences you encounter won’t have pronouns in them. This is because verbs themselves are conjugated with the subject of the sentence and often times the object as well, but this is a topic for later. Let’s look at the sentence from the last chapter.

እኔ እግር ኳስ እወዳለሁ. (Ine igir kwas iwedalehu.)

This sentence can also be written as simply:

እግር ኳስ እወዳለሁ. (Igir kwas iwedalehu.)

Here, we can drop the subject “I” because the verb (እወዳለሁ) already means “I like” on its own.
