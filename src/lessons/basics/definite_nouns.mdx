You may have noticed that there is no word for “a” in Amharic. Nouns are naturally indefinite i.e. they come with an “a” before them implicitly.

If you see ሃሳብ (hasab) in a sentence, it means “an idea”. If you see መንገድ in a sentence, it means “a street”. If you see ዛፍ in a sentence, it means “a tree.”

Now if you want to add “the” in front of these nouns and make them specific, we add the suffix -ኡ (-u) in Amharic.

The idea	ሃሳቡ
The street	መንገዱ
The tree	ዛፉ
