The Ethiopian alphabet (the Fidel) has been used since the 5th century BCE and came to its modern form during the Aksumite Empire around the 4th-5th century CE. When my Amharic teacher in college first made us learn the Fidel, I didn’t see its merit. I wanted to speak and listen, not read. I didn’t see the point. Over time however, I realized that beyond the importance of being able to read and write, knowing the alphabet makes the learning process much easier.

Amharic is a phonetic language, and this is one of its great strengths. For the most part, words are pronounced the way they’re written; it’s consistent. An English learner, on the other hand, can never be sure how to pronounce a word they’ve never seen before. This isn’t the case in Amharic. With this tool, we can capture new words on paper and in flashcards such that we can look back at them and know how they’re said. Once we learn the alphabet, we can do away with the clunky English phonetic translations that you’ll see throughout this website.

Here is the Fidel:
